If you want to have more fun and freedom in the game, you might want to try using a trainer. A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats and features. For example, you can get unlimited resources, gold, honor, and god mode.
 
One of the most popular trainers for Stronghold 3 is the one created by MrAntiFun. It works for the patched (1.10.27781+) retail/steam version of the game and has two options: infinite resources and god mode. You can download it from [here](https://mrantifun.net/threads/stronghold-3-trainer.160/).
 
To use the trainer, follow these steps:
 
1. Extract the zip file and run the trainer as administrator.
2. Start the game and load your save or start a new game.
3. Pause the game and alt-tab to the trainer.
4. Press F1 to activate the trainer.
5. Press F2 to enable infinite resources.
6. Press F3 to enable god mode.
7. Go back to the game and enjoy.

Note: You should turn off the resources cheat as soon as you get the effect in game to prevent crashes. Also, before starting a new level, deactivate the cheats by pressing F1-F3 again.
 
With this trainer, you can build your dream castle, crush your enemies, and have fun without worrying about running out of resources or losing your troops. However, use it at your own risk and discretion, as some players might consider it cheating or unfair.

Stronghold 3 is not the only game in the series. There are also Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader, Stronghold 2, Stronghold Legends, Stronghold Crusader Extreme, Stronghold Kingdoms, and Stronghold Crusader 2. Each game has its own setting, story, and gameplay elements.
 
If you are a fan of medieval strategy games, you might also enjoy other titles such as Age of Empires, Total War, Crusader Kings, Anno, and Civilization. These games offer different perspectives and challenges on history, culture, and warfare.
  
As you can see, Stronghold 3 is a game that offers a lot of possibilities and fun for strategy lovers. Whether you want to build your own castle, fight epic battles, or manage your economy, you can find something that suits your style and preferences.
 
However, the game is not perfect. It has some flaws and drawbacks that might affect your enjoyment. For example, some players have reported bugs, crashes, and performance issues. The game also has a steep learning curve and can be frustrating at times. The graphics and animations are not very impressive compared to other games of the same genre.
 
Therefore, before you decide to buy or play Stronghold 3, you should weigh the pros and cons carefully. You should also check the system requirements and compatibility of your device. If you are still interested in the game, you can find it on Steam or other online stores for a reasonable price.
 
In conclusion, Stronghold 3 is a game that has a lot of potential and appeal for fans of medieval strategy games. It has a trainer that can enhance your gaming experience and make it more fun and easy. However, it also has some drawbacks and limitations that might disappoint or frustrate you.
